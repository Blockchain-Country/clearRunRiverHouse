🔇 Keep Noise Levels Down\n\
Please be mindful of our neighbors — this is a quiet street.\n\

• Always start fires safely and slowly using proper fire-starting material.\n\
\n\
🌲 Type of Wood\n\

• Never leave an open fire unattended.\n\
\n\
💧 Extinguishing the Fire\n\

2. Once all water sources are turned off, the well will automatically refill within about **one hour**.\n\
\n\
💦 Indoor Flooding or Pipe Break\n\
The **main water shut-off valve** is located in the **side bedroom closet**.\n\
Turn the single valve there to shut off all water to the house if you notice flooding or a pipe break.\n\
\n\
📡 Internet or TV Not Working\n\
If the Wi-Fi or TV loses connection, try resetting the router:\n\
1. The router is plugged in **under the desk in the kitchen**.\n\

Reset any tripped breakers by turning them fully OFF and then back ON.\n\
\n\
🚨 Carbon Monoxide Alarm\n\
When cooking or frying, please open a window or use the exhaust fan to prevent the **carbon monoxide alarm** from being triggered.\n\
\n\
🔋 Smoke or Low-Battery Alarms\n\
If a detector beeps due to a low battery, spare batteries are available in one of the **kitchen drawers**.\n\
\n\
💡 Front Outdoor Lighting\n\
The front outdoor lights use a dual-mode switch:\n\
• **First press:** Bright lights\n\
• **Second press:** Ambient night lights\n\

• When not in use, the hot tub is kept at a **preset 80°F** to conserve energy. Heating to a higher temperature may take several hours.  
• The **control panel** is located inside the tub.  
  - To **raise** the temperature: press and hold the temperature button.  
  - To **lower** the temperature: press and hold the same button again.  
• Certain health risks may be associated with the hot tub. **Use at your own risk.**`,

### 🧖‍♀️ Sauna Rules & Operation

Please enjoy the sauna responsibly and help us keep it in excellent condition for all guests.

**Before & After Use**
• No shoes inside the sauna — bare feet or clean sandals only.  
• Do not use *aroma oils, sprays, or fragrances*. Some guests may be allergic.  
• Do not pour anything on the stones except **clean water**.  
• If you used **venik (birch whisk)**, please clean up all leaves — they fall between and under the benches.  
• If venik leaves are left behind and deep cleaning is required, an additional **$250 fee** will apply (full bench disassembly is needed).  
• Ensure the sauna retains its natural wood scent — no lotions, oils, or substances on the benches or walls.  

**Operating the Sauna**
At the bottom of the heater, you’ll find **two control knobs**:

• **Left knob:** Temperature control  
• **Right knob:** Timer  

**Timer Guide**
• Turn to the **large “1”** inside the black box → sauna starts **immediately** and runs for **1 hour**.  
• Turn past the large “1” into the **small numbered section** → this sets a **delayed start**.  
  - Small “1” = starts in 1 hour, then runs for 1 hour  
  - Small “2” = starts in 2 hours, then runs for 1 hour  

**Important**
• Keep the **ceiling air vent open** while using the sauna — proper ventilation protects the wood and prevents moisture buildup.  
• After your stay, please leave the sauna clean and free of debris.

### 🚿 Outdoor Shower

The outdoor shower is available during the warmer months.  
It is **shut off during the winter season** to prevent freeze damage.`,

### 🌡 Home Heating & Cooling Systems

The house is equipped with **two separate systems**:

• **Oil-based heating** with floor radiators  
• **Central air conditioning** for cooling  

Each floor has **independent control zones** with a total of **five thermostats**:

1. **Side Room Thermostat** — Side room + central bathroom (1st floor)  
2. **Kitchen Area Thermostat** — Living room, kitchen, game room, small bedroom (1st floor)

4. **Billiard Room Thermostat** — Billiard room (2nd floor)

• Avoid large temperature swings  

### Before Checkout
**Winter:** Set all thermostats to **55°F** (heat mode)  
**Summer:** Set all thermostats to **77°F** (cool mode)**

                            This is our personal getaway, and we’ve put a lot of effort into making it special. Please treat the home with care and leave it as you found it.\n\
                            Accidents happen, but we appreciate open communication and accountability.\n\

                            👥 Registered Guests Only\n\
                            Only guests listed in your reservation are permitted on the property.\n\
                            • No additional visitors or overnight guests without written approval.\n\

                            Please be mindful of our neighbors — this is a quiet street.\n\
                            We understand that groups may sit outside and socialize, and that children play — completely fine.\n\
                            But avoid loud music, shouting, or excessive noise, especially in the evening.\n\
                            \n\
                            Quiet Hours:\n\
                            * 10:00 PM – 8:00 AM (Weekdays)\n\
                            * 11:00 PM – 8:00 AM (Weekends)\n\
                            \n\
                            A noise-detection device (does NOT record voices) helps ensure noise stays reasonable.\n\
                            If excessive noise is detected, you may receive a warning. Continued violations result in a $100 fine and may end your stay early.\n\

                            The home uses **well water**, which may temporarily stop if too much water is used at once.\n\
                            If this happens:\n\
                            1. Check that no faucets, toilets, or outdoor spigots are running.\n\
                            2. Once all water sources are turned off, the well will automatically refill within about **one hour**.\n\

                            💦 Indoor Flooding or Pipe Break\n\
                            The **main water shut-off valve** is located in the **side bedroom closet**.\n\
                            Turn the single valve there to shut off all water to the house if you notice flooding or a pipe break.\n\

                            If the Wi-Fi or TV loses connection, try resetting the router:\n\
                            1. The router is plugged in **under the desk in the kitchen**.\n\
                            2. Unplug it, wait **30 seconds**, then plug it back in.\n\
                            3. Wait a few minutes for the internet to reconnect.\n\
                            \n\
                            ⚡ Heat, Lights, or Appliances Not Working\n\
                            If something stops working, check the **breaker box**, located on the **first floor in the side bedroom next to the side door**.\n\
                            Reset any tripped breakers by turning them fully OFF and then back ON.\n\

                            When cooking or frying, please open a window or use the exhaust fan to prevent the **carbon monoxide alarm** from being triggered.\n\
                            \n\

                            Please be mindful of our neighbors — this is a quiet street.\n\
                            We understand that groups may sit outside and socialize, and that children play — completely fine.\n\
                            But avoid loud music, shouting, or excessive noise, especially in the evening.\n\
                            \n\
                            Quiet Hours:\n\
                            * 10:00 PM – 8:00 AM (Weekdays)\n\
                            * 11:00 PM – 8:00 AM (Weekends)\n\
                            \n\
                            A noise-detection device (does NOT record voices) helps ensure noise stays reasonable.\n\
                            If excessive noise is detected, you may receive a warning. Continued violations result in a $100 fine and may end your stay early.\n\

                            Open fires are allowed **only between 9:00 AM and 12:00 midnight**.\n\

                            🔥 Lighting the Fire\n\
                            • Never use flammable liquids (gasoline, kerosene, lighter fluid) to start or relight a fire.\n\
                            • Always start fires safely and slowly using proper fire-starting material.\n\

                            Avoid using softwoods such as **pine or cedar**, as they can “pop” and send sparks into the air, increasing fire risk.\n\
                            \n\
                            👀 Supervision\n\

                            • Never leave an open fire unattended.\n\

                            Before leaving the area:\n\
                            • Allow the fire to burn down completely.\n\
                            • Pour water over the embers until they are **cool to the touch**.\n\
                            Remember: ashes can remain hot for up to **24 hours**.\n\
                            \n\
                            🌬 Weather Conditions\n\
